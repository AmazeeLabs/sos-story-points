        <h1>Estimating with Story Points</h1>
        <h2>Explaining story points, what they mean, and how we use them.</h2>
      </header>
      <h3>So you may be asking:</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>What are Story Points?</dt>
        <dd>
          Story points rate the <em>complexity</em> of a task, relative to the
          complexity of other tasks.
        </dd>
        <dt>So they're hours?</dt>
        <dd>
          Nope! Story points rate <em>complexity</em>, not <em>time</em>. A task
          might take me longer to build than you, but we can probably agree that
          it is more or less complicated than another task.
        </dd>
        <dt>Give me an example.</dt>
        <dd>
          I can't tell you how much a motorcycle or a pickup or an airplane
          weighs, but I can tell you that a motorcycle weighs less than an
          airplane, and a pickup is somewhere in the middle.
        </dd>
        <dt>So how do you estimate with this?</dt>
        <dd>
          Over time, a team's average velocity will reveal about how much
          complexity they can build in a given time. This helps predict how long
          a backlog will take to build. Building on the example, stakeholders
          can decide if they want five motorcycles or one airplane this sprint.
        </dd>
        <dt>Sounds stupid.</dt>
        <dd>
          Estimating is never perfect, but hours have a tendency to vary wildly
          while waiting for follow-up meetings, getting clarifications, variance
          between developers' skills, etc. But over time, a project team has a
          tendency toward a predictable velocity.
        </dd>
        <dt>How do we all agree on complexity?</dt>
        <dd>
          As a company with many teams, if we can all come to a somewhat common
          understanding of rating complexity, estimates become portable and our
          gained business intelligence can be shared across teams.
        </dd>
        <dt>We've used "shirt sizes" lately.</dt>
        <dd>
          Nothing wrong with that, but S + L isn't mathematically useful the
          same way 3 + 13 is. Story point values are 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and 20.
          Your PO/PM probably translated your shirt sizes into these numbers.
        </dd>
