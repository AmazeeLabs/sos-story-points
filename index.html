        <h1>Story Points</h1>
        <h2>What they mean &amp; how we use them</h2>
      </header>
      <h3>So you may be thinking:</h3>
      <dl>
        <div>
          <dt>What are Story Points?</dt>
          <dd>
            Story points rate the <em>complexity</em> of a task, relative to the
            complexity of other tasks.
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>So they're hours?</dt>
          <dd>
            Nope! Story points rate <em>complexity</em>, not <em>time</em>. A
            task might take me longer to build than you, but we can probably
            agree that it is more or less complicated than another task.
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>Give me an example.</dt>
          <dd>
            I can't tell you how much a motorcycle or a pickup or an airplane
            weighs, but I can tell you that a motorcycle weighs less than an
            airplane, and a pickup is somewhere in the middle.
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>So how do you estimate with this?</dt>
          <dd>
            Over time, a team's average velocity will reveal about how much
            complexity they can build in a given time. This helps predict how
            long a backlog will take to build. Building on the example,
            stakeholders can decide if they want five motorcycles or one
            airplane this sprint.
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>Sounds stupid.</dt>
          <dd>
            Estimating is never perfect, but hours have a tendency to vary
            wildly while waiting for follow-up meetings, getting clarifications,
            variance between developers' skills, etc. But over time, a project
            team has a tendency toward a predictable velocity.
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>How do we pick a size?</dt>
          <dd>
            Debate with teammates about how a story might be completed, you
            might know a shortcut and someone else may anticipate a pitfall.
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>How do we standardize?</dt>
          <dd>
            As a company with many teams, if we can all come to a somewhat
            common understanding of rating complexity, estimates become portable
            and our gained business intelligence can be shared across teams.
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>We've used &ldquo;shirt sizes&rdquo; lately.</dt>
          <dd>
            Nothing wrong with that, but S + L isn't mathematically useful the
            same way 3 + 13 is. Story point values are 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, and 20.
            Your PO/PM probably translated your shirt sizes into these numbers.
